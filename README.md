# Fetch_NLP_Project

NLP Task - Documentation / Steps:
1-	Zip file Containing Code + Csv Files Provided for Project.
2-	(RAG)_Retrival_Augmented_Generation_using_Llama_2_7b,_BAAI_Embeddings,_FAISS_&_Langchain File contain the complete code of the Project.
3-	Upload the extracted folder from zip file to your Google Drive.
4-	Open(RAG)_Retrival_Augmented_Generation_using_Llama_2_7b,_BAAI_Embeddings,_FAISS_&_Langchain,ipynb in Google Colab. 
Link Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
5-	Start Running it cell by cell – After running third cell you need to provide your Hugging Face Token – Similarly If you do not have Llama-2-7b access You need to Apply for it from Meta (It usually takes two days to approve).
`           You need to Apply for Llama-2-Access on Hugging face from Meta if you do not have:
             Link for Llama-2 access: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
             Hugging Face Link: https://huggingface.co/
6-	In one cell – we are mounting Google drive so that You can copy your csv file paths from there and can update in project for running it successfully.
7-	We are utilizing LangChain for orchestration, BAAI Embeddings for creating embeddings, & FAISS for Indexing with Meta,s Llama_2_7b Model.
8-	The solution is utilizing all open-source Latest Tools and Technologies.
